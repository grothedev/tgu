		<h5>Mission:</h5>
		<p>to bring together different student sustainability organizations to make Iowa State students more aware of sustainable efforts around them. Our goals are three-fold:</h6>
		
			<ol style = "margin-left: 4rem;">
				<li>Create an open forum for discussion about Green Initiatives at ISU. </li>
				<li>Act as one voice to ISU administration about student sustainability issues</li> 
				<li>Brainstorm ways to teach students how they can make their lives more sustainable, how they can participate in Go Green efforts, and how they can voice their opinions on sustainable issues.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
			Clubs and organizations included in The Green Umbrella are concerned with issues of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. 
		</p>

		<h5>Special Events</h5>
		<h6>Each academic year we hold three special events, National Campus Sustainability Day, Sustainapalooza, and Earth Day. <a href = "/events">Read about them here</a>.</h6>
		
		<h5>About this website</h5>
		<h6>This website will serve to help students become aware of sustainable initiatives at ISU and in Ames, as well as provide information on how to get involved. This includes clubs, community organizations, and businesses. The website also hopes to make collaboration between clubs easier by providing a space for them to share what they're all about and what they're trying to do. There is also a discussion board for students to participate in free open discourse on matters of sustainability.</h6>
