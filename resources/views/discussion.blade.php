		It is obvious that the human species is not living in a sustainable way, and as humans, it is our job to fix that, assuming we want to continue this evolution of life. And since we are all students at this educational institution called Iowa State University, it makes sense to begin our efforts right here.

		The university is an entity that exists within and interacts with the rest of the universe. The professors give knowledge to students and receive money, the university invests in stock hoping to generate funds, the buses move people around from place to place, lecturers and prominent thinkers of the day come to give speaches, the grass photosynthesizes, the students eat the food at the dining centers. How do these processes affect their adjacent systems, and so on? The professor might use his/her money to buy some vegetables from the farmers market, supporting the local economy; a student might use his education to get a job making bombs for the military industrial complex, supporting the federal economy; an oil company may happen to find a regulatory loophole allowing them to contaminate the water supply of millions of people, and the university gets a little more spending money; the buses allow people to travel around fast within the city; an interesting idea may open a door within the mind of a student, leading him/her into a more fulfilling course of study; the grass doesn’t really do much, it’s just green rectangles; the food from the dining center will supply the student with either physical and mental nourishment or agitation, depending on what he/she chooses to eat. It can be seen that these processes and systems could be analyzed infinitely as they ripple through their respective mediums, whether that be the economy, collective psyche, or simply space-time itself. We are interested in the mediums which give us clues to how sustainable a given process/system may be.

		Our goal here is to look at the “sustainability” of the different functions of the university, and change unsustainable ones into sustainable ones. This discussion board serves to provide a space for free, open, organized discussion on matters of sustainability here at ISU. We encourage you to sign up and share your thoughts.
